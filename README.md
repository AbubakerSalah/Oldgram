## About

I built this solo project while learning essential CSS concepts through Scrimba's [Frontend Career Path courses](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). Figma design was provided by Scrimba and the project was built from scratch by me.

Total dev time: 6 hours

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 
- CSS
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned
HTML and CSS: Constructed a structured HTML document and applied styles using CSS for visual presentation.

JavaScript: Interactivity: Implemented JavaScript for handling user interactions, particularly the like button functionality.

DOM Manipulation: Manipulated the DOM to dynamically update content based on user actions, such as updating like counts.
Code Organization: Maintained structured and organized code for better readability.
